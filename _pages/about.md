I am currently a Master student in the School of Computer Science and Technology, [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Prof.[Hui Xiong](http://datamining.rutgers.edu/). <br>

# Research
My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning and data mining, particularly in
(multi-agent) deep reinforcement learning, graph neural network and adversarial learning as well as
their applications to various data mining scenarios and natural language processing.
